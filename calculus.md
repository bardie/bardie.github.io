## Calculus

Calculus is involves the study of rates of change. The fundamental idea of calculus is to study change by studying "instantaneous " change, by which we mean changes over tiny intervals of time. It is commonly used in engineering, economics, statistics, and medicine.

### Why is it important?

It allows us to construct relatively simple quantitative formulas and deduce their consequences. With calculus, you can be able to learn how to model and control systems.

In Cyber Security we deal with traffic within a certain time. The motion of an element under analysis is then characterized by the set of its numerical positions at relevant points in time. The set of positions and times that we use to describe motion is what we call a function. And similar functions are used to describe the quantities of interest in all the systems to which calculus is applied.

### Questions Answered by Calculus

1. Differentiation: How to find the instantaneous change?
2. Derivatives: What is the rate of change?
3. Intergration: What is the accumulation over time?

### Calculus in Cyber Security
In Cyber Security, Calculus is used to determine and identify changes within an organisations network. Examples include changes in the amount traffic, number of users, access to external and internal data etc.

Cyber Security Analysts can use calculus to:
*   Predict an increase or decrease of traffic within a network.
*   Identify anomalous activity within the network.
*   Identify rogue users or devices on the network
