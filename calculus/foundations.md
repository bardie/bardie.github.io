## Calculus Foundations

###Numbers
A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. A category of numbers is Natural numbers, which are 

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 ..........
```

Natural numbers can go past a million, a billion, a trillion, and so on.

###Operations
There are four types of operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x) and division (÷).

```
12 x 20 = 240
137 + 150 = 287
143 - 12 = 131
12 ÷ 2 = 6
120 - 500 = -380
```
###Rational Numbers
Ratios of integers are called rational numbers, and you get one for any pairs of integers, so long as the second integer, called the denominator, is not zero.

```
  When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
  \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]

```
