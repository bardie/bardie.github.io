## Calculus Foundations

### Numbers

A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. A category of numbers is Natural numbers, which are 

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 ..........
```

Natural numbers can go past a million, a billion, a trillion, and so on.

### Operations

There are four types of operations: 

#### Addition (+)

<div class="math">
<p>
\(12 + 20 = 240\)
</p>
<p>
\(\frac{1}{3}\) + \(\frac{3}{7}\) = \(\frac{1 . 7}{3 . 7}\) + \(\frac{3 . 3}{3 . 7}\) = \(\frac{16}{21}\)
</p>
</div>

#### Subtraction (-)

<div class="math">
<p>
\(143 - 12 = 131\)
</p>
<p>
\(\frac{1}{4}\) - \(\frac{5}{6}\) = \(\frac{1 . 5}{4 . 6}\) = \(\frac{5}{24}\)
</p>
</div>

#### Multiplication (x)

<div class="math">
<p>
\(12 x 6 = 36\)
</p>
<p>
\(\frac{1}{4}\) x \(\frac{5}{6}\) = \(\frac{1 . 5}{4 . 6}\) = \(\frac{5}{24}\)
</p>
</div>

#### Division (÷).

<div class="math">
<p>
\(12 ÷ 2 = 6\)
</p>
<p>
\(\frac{3}{4}\) ÷ \(\frac{5}{7}\) = \(\frac{3}{4}\) x \(\frac{7}{5}\) = \(\frac{3 . 7}{4 . 5}\) = \(\frac{21}{20}\)
</p>
<p>
7\(\frac{2}{5}\) = \(\frac{7}{1}\) + \(\frac{2}{5}\) = \(\frac{7 . 5}{1 . 5}\) + \(\frac{2}{5}\) = \(\frac{35}{5}\) + \(\frac{2}{5}\) = \(\frac{37}{5}\)
</p>
  <p>
\(\frac{11}{7}\) = \(11 ÷ 7 = 1 R 4 \) = 1 \(\frac{4}{7}\)
</p>
</div>

### Rational Numbers

Ratios of integers are called rational numbers, and you get one for any pairs of integers, so long as the second integer, called the denominator, is not zero.

Example: &frac14;
