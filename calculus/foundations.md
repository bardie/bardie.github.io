## Calculus Foundations

### Numbers

#### Natural Numbers (N)

Also called positive integers, counting numbers, or natural numbers.
```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 ..........
```

#### Whole Numbers (W)

This is the set of  natural numbers, plus zero

```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 ..........
```

#### Integers (Z)

This is the set of all whole numbers plus all the negatives (or opposites) of the natural numbers.

```
......, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, ..........
```

#### Rational Numbers (Q)

Ratios of integers are called rational numbers or Fractions. This is all the fractions where the top and bottom numbers are integers; e.g., 1/2, 3/4, 7/2, ⁻4/3, 4/1 [Note: The denominator cannot be 0, but the numerator can be].

#### Real Numbers (R)

Real numbers (R), (also called measuring numbers or measurement numbers). This includes all numbers that can be written as a decimal. This includes fractions written in decimal form e.g., 0.5, 0.75 2.35, ⁻0.073, 0.3333, or 2.142857. It also includes all the irrational numbers such as π, √2 etc. Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line.

#### Complex Numbers (C)

Complex numbers are useful abstract quantities that can be used in calculations and result in physically meaningful solutions. 

Example:

<div class="math">
<p>
 \(z = x + i y \)
</p>
</div>


### Operations

There are four types of operations: 

#### Addition (+)

<div class="math">
<p>
a)   \(12 + 20 = 240\)
</p>
<p>
b)   \(\frac{1}{3}\) + \(\frac{3}{7}\) = \(\frac{1 \times 7}{3 \times 7}\) + \(\frac{3 \times 3}{3 \times 7}\) = \(\frac{16}{21}\)
</p>
</div>

#### Subtraction (-)

<div class="math">
<p>
c)   \(143 - 12 = 131\)
</p>
<p>
d)   \(\frac{1}{4}\) - \(\frac{5}{6}\) = \(\frac{1 \times 5}{4 \times 6}\) = \(\frac{5}{24}\)
</p>
</div>

#### Multiplication (x)

<div class="math">
<p>
e)   \(12 \times 6 = 36\)
</p>
<p>
f)   \(\frac{1}{4}\) \(\times\) \(\frac{5}{6}\) = \(\frac{1 \times 5}{4 \times 6}\) = \(\frac{5}{24}\)
</p>
</div>

#### Division (÷).

<div class="math">
<p>
g)   \(12 \div 2 = 6\)
</p>
<p>
h)   \(\frac{3}{4}\) \(\div\) \(\frac{5}{7}\) = \(\frac{3}{4}\) \(\times\) \(\frac{7}{5}\) = \(\frac{3 \times 7}{4 \times 5}\) = \(\frac{21}{20}\)
</p>
<p>
i)   7\(\frac{2}{5}\) = \(\frac{7}{1}\) + \(\frac{2}{5}\) = \(\frac{7 \times 5}{1 . 5}\) + \(\frac{2}{5}\) = \(\frac{35}{5}\) + \(\frac{2}{5}\) = \(\frac{37}{5}\)
</p>
<p>
j)   \(\frac{11}{7}\) = \(11 \div 7 = 1 R 4 \) = 1 \(\frac{4}{7}\)
</p>
</div>

### BODMAS
Based on the BODMAS rule, **Brackets (B)** have to be solved first followed by **Orders (O)** - powers or roots (i.e. of), then **Division (D)**, **Multiplication (M)**, **Addition (A)** and at the end **Subtraction (S)**. Solving any expression is considered correct only if the BODMAS rule or the PEDMAS rule is followed to solve it.

### Fibonacci Numbers

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

*   the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
*   the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
*   the 5 is (2+3),
*   and so on!
