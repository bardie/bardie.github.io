## Calculus Foundations

### Numbers

A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. A category of numbers is Natural numbers, which are 

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 ..........
```

Natural numbers can go past a million, a billion, a trillion, and so on.

### Operations

There are four types of operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x) and division (รท).

```
12 x 20 = 240
137 + 150 = 287
143 - 12 = 131
12 รท 2 = 6
120 - 500 = -380
```
### Rational Numbers

Ratios of integers are called rational numbers, and you get one for any pairs of integers, so long as the second integer, called the denominator, is not zero.

Example: <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>
&frac14;
