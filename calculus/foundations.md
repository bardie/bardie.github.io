## Calculus Foundations

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that involves the study of rates of change. The universe is constantly moving and changing.  Calculus is used in physics, engineering, economics, statistics, and medicine. Calculus is also used in such disparate areas as space travel, as well as determining how medications interact with the body, and even how to build safer structures. 

In Cyber Security, Calculus will be used to determine changes within an organisations network. This includes changes in the amount traffic, number of users, access to external and internal data etc.
