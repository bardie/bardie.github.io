## Inequalities

An inequality compares two values, showing if one is less than, greater than, or simply not equal to another value.

**Equal To**
<div class="math">
<p>
\(a = b\)
</p>
</div>
**Not Equal To**
<div class="math">
<p>
\(a ≠ b\)
</p>
</div>
**Less Than**
<div class="math">
<p>
\(a < b\)
</p>
</div>
**Greater Than**
<div class="math">
<p>
\(a > b\)
</p>
</div>
**Less Than or Equal To**
<div class="math">
<p>
\(a ≤ b\)
</p>
</div>
**Greater Than or Equal To**
<div class="math">
<p>
\(a ≥ b\)
</p>
</div>

### Cyber Security Example

In order for a bruteforce attack rule to be triggered on the security monitoring system, a user has to attempt at least 5 failed logins. Tom has failed to log into a device 3 times. How many failed logons must Tom attempt before the rule is triggered?

#### Solution

Let x = the number of failed logons. The failed number of failed logons must be greater than 5:

<div class="math">
<p>
\(3 + x ≥ 5\)
</p>
<p>
\(x ≥ 5 - 3\)
</p>
<p>
\(x ≥ 2\)
</p>
</div>

Tom must attempt 2 or more failed logon attempts to trigger the bruteforce attack rule.

#### Example 2

<div class="math">
<p> \(3 + 2x \lt 7\) </p>
<p>
\( 2x \lt 7 - 3 \)
</p>
<p>
\( 2x \lt 4 \)
</p>
<p>
\(x \lt 4 \div 2 \)
</p>
<p>
\(x \lt 2 \)
</p>
</div>
